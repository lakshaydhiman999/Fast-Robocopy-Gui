## 🔥 Key Advance Features

* **Extreme Multithreaded-Transfer (MT:32):** This tool leverages **multithreaded-transfer** by creating 32 parallel data streams. It acts as an **ssd-performance-tweak**, utilizing your hardware's full potential to push transfer speeds to their absolute limit.
* **Intelligent Logging System:** Every operation auto-generates a detailed record in `copy_log.txt`. This makes it a professional-grade **system-tool** for tracking successful, skipped, or failed tasks.
* **Smart GUI Dialogs:** This **robocopy-gui** features PowerShell-powered visual pickers, eliminating the need for manual path entry and preventing human errors like typos.
* **Fail-Safe & Restartable Mode (/ZB):** As a robust **batch-file-utility**, it supports the `/ZB` mode. If a transfer is interrupted by a network or disk disconnection, it can resume exactly where it left off.
* **Automatic Administrator Elevation:** This **open-source-windows** script automatically detects and requests Admin rights, ensuring system-level files and advanced copy modes function without permission errors.
* **Fast-File-Copy Optimization:** Whether you are moving thousands of tiny files or massive game folders, the architecture is tuned to maintain a consistent **fast-file-copy** speed.
* **Real-time ETA & Progress:** Monitor your data transfer with a live status display and an accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
* **Completion Alert:** Includes a built-in system beep notification to alert you the moment the task is finished.
